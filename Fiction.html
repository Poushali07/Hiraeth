            <br>There are certain things one can learn from “The Alchemist”. 
            <br>Its all about following your dream and about taking the risk of pursuing them.
            <br>Superficially deep, but actually rather pretentious new age waffle - yet somehow manages to be beautiful.

            <br>The world built in these books is so real and tangible, it is truly a masterpiece. 
            <br>The characters are engaging and brilliant, and I love how the plot is so interwoven 
            <br>and twisted within itself, especially in the last book.
            <br>I was taken by surprise when I started the series, I didn't think it would pull me in as it did.

            <br>A fantastic read.The stories of Mahabharatha were a part of my growing up. 
            <br>But i had never paused to think about what the people involved really felt and thought. 
            <br>So it was a surprise to read about Draupadi's feelings in her own words.

            <br>“You’re such a bad influence,”
            <br>“Only the bad can be influenced, Princess.”</br>
            <br>That might make no sense to you but it makes perfect sense to me and to Hawke
            <br>who might just be my very first book crush. This book started with frustration. 
            <br>I just grumbled a lot. I think my brain and my heart are still reeling from the 
            <br>rollercoaster of emotions in the last 20% of the book.
