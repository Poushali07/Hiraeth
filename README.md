## Codathon Webdev Project 

### - Name of the Project:  Hiraeth
### - The website is basically a book reviewing website. Where we can get  minimalistic information  about a book of a particular genre. The website has been developed in a manner such that all the book of a certain genre are in a single page and can be accessed by clicking on the desired genre button in the Homepage.

### - Tech Used: HTML and CSS
### - Motivation: Being a CSE freshmen, the first tech-thing I came across was Webdev. Codathon gave me an oppurtunity to explore various aspects of this field. I ended up creating a website that is about BOOKS,and my admiration for them. Also apart from the website being a review website I wanted to keep records of my readlist and what else could me more appropriate than creating a webpage about books and their reviews.
