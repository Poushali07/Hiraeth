             <br>This is one unsettling little thriller and the best bit about 
             <br>it is that no one can be trusted, including the three female narrators 
             <br>who share the storytelling of this book. I literally read this entire novel 
             <br>in one sitting and I now need to find the words to convince you to go get your hands on it. 
             <br>RIGHT NOW.

            <br>In Murder in the Mews, a collection of shorts, Poirot's razor-sharp mind 
            <br>is pitted against such stumpers as a suicide/murder conundrum, a deadly love triangle,
            <br>and a case of important papers gone missing.
